# cif_ed

Data names for describing electron diffraction. These are presented here as a CIF extension dictionary, but in practice many are equally applicable to X-ray or neutron studies, and so theis draft, when approved by COMCIFS, might best be incorporated into the existing core CIF and possibly imgCIF dictionaries.

This project is best seen as an opportunity to focus on the new items required in the context of electron crystallography, and to invite content review from the user community.
