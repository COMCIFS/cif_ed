# Updates of the cif dictionary and checkcif procedure to accommodate 3D ED data

##1.	Introduction

One of the aims of the NanED project is proposing and introducing standards for recording, reporting and validation of the crystal structures determined by the 3D ED techniques. To that end, the Standardization committee of the NanED consortium (NanED SC) was established with the task of coordinating the effort. 

After discussions on the topic, the NanED SC proposes the roadmap to the necessary changes to the CIF dictionary and changes to the CheckCIF procedure. This document summarizes the proposal and serves as the starting point for the broader discussion within the electron diffraction community.

##2.	Changes to the CIF dictionary

*	Adding a keyword specifying if precession electron diffraction was used..
Possible keyword: `_diffrn_precession_angle XX` (numerical value in degrees)

*	Adding a keyword specifying if the refinement was kinematical or dynamical..
Possible keyword: `_refine_diffraction_theory 'value'`, with permitted values ‘kinematical’, ‘dynamical’, ‘two-beam’

*	Adding an additional option to `_chemical_absolute_configuration`. In addition to the existing options, an option ‘dyn’ could be used to specify determination by dynamical refinement

*	Adding tools for specifying the orientation of individual frames. Possible specification:

```
loop_
_diffrn_frame_id
_diffrn_frame_u
_diffrn_frame_v
_diffrn_frame_w
_diffrn_frame_omega
_diffrn_frame_phi
_diffrn_frame_chi
1  0.15802  0.20648 -1.00000 1.000 -53.011 -0.349    22.438     0.910
2  0.15272  0.19983 -1.00000 1.000 -52.556 -0.285    22.429     0.984

#3.	Changes to the CheckCIF procedure

*	Recognize kinematical and dynamical refinement
*	For kinematical refinement, relax limits for Alerts A/B for some quantities. The proposed quantities are:
* * 	Rint – alert A above 25%, alert B above 15%
* * 	Robs – Alert A above 25%, alert B above 18%
* * 	wRall2 – what would be suitable limits?
Affected alerts: **PLAT082, PLAT084, RINTA01**
*	Relax the limit for the alert on Low Bond Precision on C-C Bonds. What would be a suitable value ? Affected alert: **PLAT340**

*	For dynamical refinement remove alerts A and B for missing Rint. Affected alert: **PLAT881**

*	Adjust the limits for the alert on too long Long O-H bond, because in electron diffraction it is normal to obtain longer bonds than the neutron values. Affected alert : **PLAT355**
